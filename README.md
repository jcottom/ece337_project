## Git workflow:
See [this guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-git-team-environment/) for git collaboration guidelines.
For example, if Ryan wants to work on a module:
* Ryan creates and switches to a new branch
* He adds a new module or makes appropriate changes to an existing one
* When he is done (everything works) he will pull from the master branch and merge his branch into master

So basically, no one should ever work directly in master and everything in master should always work.
